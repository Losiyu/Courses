## LOGO

![](https://github.com/Losiyu/Design/blob/master/SC2%20Forum/LOGO/LOGO256.png)

#### Colors: colors from three races as I designed in the color palette.

> Why
> Red and gold are at the bottom side because Terran and Protoss are alliance. Darkorchid at the top side because Zerg is invader and along with other races.

#### Shape: triangle means innovation, solid and power

> Why
> As a game strategies forum, the most essential thing is to share credible and powerful strategies. So all the characteristics of the triangle such as innovation, solid and power all all related to strategy.

#### Meaning:

- three races at each side means balance
- The symbol “V” below means victory and credible game strategy
