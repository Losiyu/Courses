**Game Background：**

StartCraft2 is a Real-Time strategy game, which has its League and world tournament. In this type of game, victory and strength are the essential theme and purposes of players and games.

**Game Story:**

The background game designed by Blizzard is the war between three races: Zerg, Terran, and Protoss.

**Color Theme of Game:**

In the series of game CGs(Computer Graphics showing the game and game story), we can find the characteristic of the three unique races:

- Zerg is swarming and destructive
- Terran is loyal and fearless
- Protoss is cohesive and powerful

So, base on the features of the three races, I designed three colors theme on their own strategy page.

**Why these colors:**

1. Three main colors:

   
   Because the victory and strength is the main feature of the game, so three main colors for three races are all saturated color. I am going to use their own color to design their strategy page.

   - ![img](https://github.com/Losiyu/Design/blob/master/SC2%20Forum/Color%20Palette/cc14c6.png) In the story video, purple is the main color for Zerg and their Queen.
     How do I adjust: Zerg is the most terrible race in this game, I designed it darker similar to dark orchid to show its power and to describe the helpless feeling when Protoss and Terran see the swarm rush into the city.

   - ![img](https://github.com/Losiyu/Design/blob/master/SC2%20Forum/Color%20Palette/ff1e00.png) In the story video, no main color for Terran.
     How do I adjust: Although there is no color suggestion in the story video, I give red for Terran. One of the main storylines is the commander of Terran framed Hero Renault’s lover Kerrigan, who becomes the queen of Zerg in the future. As I understand fidelity, revenge, and brave are all related to red. On the other hand, red is in harmony with darkorchid and gold.

   - ![img](https://github.com/Losiyu/Design/blob/master/SC2%20Forum/Color%20Palette/ffd007.png) In the story video, golden is the main color for Protoss.
     How do I adjust: I am still going to use gold for Protoss because it is their armor color. And it is also the default building color in the video and game, which Zerg and Terran do not have. Currently, Gold is the best color to characterize Protoss.

     

2. Two background color:

   
   Light blue and cold blue are two colors I choose for the color of the menu and shading of the word. No matter how the story is, SCGO is a strategy forum, the information show should be professional and powerful. Besides, I find three main colors are all in warm color, which needs some other colors to show the calm and intelligent are a good player should have.

   - ![img](https://github.com/Losiyu/Design/blob/master/SC2%20Forum/Color%20Palette/0931c2.png) StarCraft story background is about star war, dark blue is an indispensable color for all the scenery. 

   - ![img](https://github.com/Losiyu/Design/blob/master/SC2%20Forum/Color%20Palette/bdeede.png) Light blue is an unsaturated transition color on the page, which will use on the transition module and word shading.

     

3. White and black:

   The purpose of the website is to share the strategy and information in word. White or nearly white background and black word is the best way to show them clearly.
