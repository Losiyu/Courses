**Reason:** 

- Color: the color I use was the main background color I designed in the color palette. I am not going the add other colors because my logo is already a multi-color design
- Shape: the font of the word is not regular, which is very special and impressive.  Also, sharp character means aggressive and fight for victory.

## **Font:**

- Title: PT Serif Bold
- Headline: Robot Bold
- Body: Robot regular

**Font chosen:**

- PT Serif: The impression of this font is strong and confident, which is what I need in a strategy forum.
- Roboto: This is one of the most popular font. Because only the strategy introduction page needs a large part of the text. So it just needs a clear and user familiar font.
